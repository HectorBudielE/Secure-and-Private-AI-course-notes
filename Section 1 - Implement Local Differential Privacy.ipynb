Thus, if we collect a bunch of samples and it turns out that 60% of people answer yes, then we know that the TRUE distribution is actually centered around 70%, because 70% averaged wtih 50% (a coin flip) is 60% which is the result we obtained. \n","\n","However, it should be noted that, especially when we only have a few samples, this comes at the cost of accuracy.
